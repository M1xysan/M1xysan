### 🪞 About Me
Heya!! ^^ I'm ***Dunes Mixy*** — or ***Zerune Korvine*** if you’ve met my galactic side 💫  
I’m 18 years old (turning 19 in December!) and a creative soul who loves world-building, design, and expressing identity through every art form possible.  
Mostly curious about *learning new things, building AUs, and creating stories that feel alive.*

- 💭 Pronouns: they / she / he (change sometimes — go with what feels right 💜)  
- 🧠 Neurodivergent: ADHD + Dyslexic + Creative chaos in one brain  
- 🎨 Art style: surrealist + illustrative + emotional  
- 🪩 Current obsession: MHA AUs, shapeshifter lore, and galactic aesthetics  
- 🕊️ Motto: “Everything all above.”
